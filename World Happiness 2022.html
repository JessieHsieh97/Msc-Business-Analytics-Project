The World Happiness Report is an annual publication that measures and analyzes the happiness and well-being of people in countries around the world. It is produced by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and powered by the Gallup World Poll data. First published in 2012, the World Happiness Report has become an important tool for policymakers, researchers, and the general public to better understand the factors that contribute to happiness and well-being. It provides insights into the social and economic conditions that affect people's lives around the world, and is used to inform government policies and promote sustainable development.

It reflects how well a country is doing in terms of economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.

        <br>Besides Dystopia +residual, we can see that the top three countries in 2022 have a high score in GDP per capita and Social support. <br>This suggests that the success of the Scandinavian welfare state is reflected in the high happiness rankings, as the Nordic social welfare model continues to deliver high levels of well-being to its citizens. Moreover, the similarity in the six scores implies that this may be the secret combination toward a high happiness score!

          <b>Economic Production</b>, <b>Social Support</b>, <b>Life Expectancy</b>, <b>Freedom</b>, <b>Absence of Corruption</b>, and <b>Generosity</b>. <br />These factors contribute to
overall life evaluations and determine whether a country's happiness level is higher or lower than that of Dystopia, a hypothetical country that represents the world's lowest national averages for each of the six factors. In other words, the happiness score measures how well a country is doing in these key areas compared to the worst-case scenario.
